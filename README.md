# Control Theory from Scratch

*A control theory note — balancing rigor with intuition.*


## Overview
This repository is a personal exploration of control theory.  
It collects notes, derivations, and small implementations built while studying feedback systems, stability, and modern control methods.  

The aim is to bridge theory and practice: from classical tools like Bode plots and root locus, to state–space methods and optimal control.  

## References
These are the texts and resources that currently inform the notebooks. I list each book with a quick note on the chapters or topics it most strongly supports.

# Dynamics Under Control

*A control theory note — balancing rigor with intuition.*


## Overview
This repository is a personal exploration of control theory.  
It collects notes, derivations, and small implementations built while studying feedback systems, stability, and modern control methods.  

The aim is to bridge theory and practice: from classical tools like Bode plots and root locus, to state–space methods and optimal control.

  - Structure, tuning, and implementation  
- Design of feedback controllers  
  - Lead, lag, and lead–lag compensation  
  - Tradeoffs between robustness and performance
